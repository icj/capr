# capr

capr allows you to interact with your REDCap project from R. It has
two main goals:

* Call your REDCap project and pull your data, dictionary, and/or event 
  structures into R.

* Push data from R up to your REDCap project.

The package is developmental and is used in my workflow, so it may not work for 
you. You've been warned.

You can install the latest development version from github with

```R
devtools::install_github("icj/capr")
```
